Overview
--------
This command-line backup utility takes a snapshot of the data in a Smartsheet Team or Enterprise account and saves it to local storage.  Only the sheets (including attachments and discussions) owned by users of the account are backed up.


Requirements
------------
* Java Runtime Edition 7 (latest version)
* API access token generated by a Smartsheet account administrator (SysAdmin).  Please see this help article [http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/520100-user-types](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/520100-user-types) to learn about Smartsheet user types, and [http://www.smartsheet.com/developers/api-faq](http://www.smartsheet.com/developers/api-faq) for instructions on how to generate an API access token.


Limitations
--------
* Only multi-user plans (Team and Enterprise) are supported.  Single-user plans (Basic and Advanced) are not supported at this time.
* Incremental backups are not supported at this time.
* Sheets which have been shared to the members of the Smartsheet account, but are not owned by them, will not be backed up.
* Workspace discussions and attachments are not backed up.

How it works
--------
* The backup utility checks whether the specified output directory already exists.  If it does, the utility renames the directory to include its last modified timestamp, and creates a new output directory.
* For each active user in the account, the backup utility first creates a local directory that matches the user's email address, and then retrieves and backs up all the sheets owned by that user.
* Within each user's directory, the sheets are organized hierarchically (by folders and workspaces) to match the user's Home tab hierarchy in Smartsheet.
* Each sheet is saved as an XLS file that matches the Sheet's name, with discussions saved on a second tab inside the XLS file.  All file attachments are saved in a directory named "[Sheet Name] - attachments".  
* Non-file attachments (Google Drive files, Box files, and web URLs) are stored in a file called "[Sheet Name] - non-file attachments.csv" in the same directory as the file attachments. The following properties are provided for each non-file attachment: Name, URL, and AttachmentType.

Usage
------------
The tool will look for smartsheet-backup.properties file in the current directory (the directory from which it is being executed).
Edit the properties file to set the following parameters:

* "accessToken" (required) - access token that belongs to your Smartsheet account administrator.  See the Requirements section above on how to get an access token
* "outputDir" (required) - desired output directory.  You can provide an absolute * path (e.g., "C:\some\directory") or a path relative to the directory in which the backup utility resides (e.g., "some\directory")
* "zipOutputDir" (optional, default is false) - set to true to create a ziped archive of the outputDir
* "downloadThreads" (optional, default is 4) - set to desired number of threads used to download attachments
* "continueOnError" (optional, default false) - set to false to halt the backup execution on exception

To execute the backup, run the following command "java -jar smartsheet-org-backup.jar".
Since it's a runnable jar, you don't need to set classpath or copy other jars. Everything you need is in the runnable jar.


Logging
------------------
* All the messages, including what is backed up as well as the folders and files being created, are logged to stdout.
* A divider line is logged for each active user backed up by the tool.  Inactive users are skipped.
* All the waits and retries resulting from 503 Service Unavailable errors are logged.
* All asynchronous download requests as well as the attachments downloaded are logged.
* The tool exits with exit code 0 on success, and -1 on failure.
* Errors are prepended "\*\*\*ERROR\*\*\*" and logged.
* Upon successful completion (no errors), the tool will output a brief summary including "\*\*\* Org backup done... \*\*\*" along with the number of users backed up and time elapsed.
